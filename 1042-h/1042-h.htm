READING OF LIFE</h2>
<h3>THE VITAL CHOICE</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Or</span> shall we run with
Artemis<br />
Or yield the breast to Aphrodite?<br />
Both are mighty;<br />
Both give bliss;<br />
Each can torture if divided;<br />
Each claims worship undivided,<br />
In her wake would have us wallow.</p>
<h4><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>II</h4>
<p class="poetry">Youth must offer on bent knees<br />
Homage unto one or other;<br />
Earth, the mother,<br />
This decrees;<br />
And unto the pallid Scyther<br />
Either points us shun we either<br />
Shun or too devoutly follow.</p>
<h3><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>WITH THE
HUNTRESS</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Through</span> the
water-eye of night,<br />
Midway between eve and dawn,<br />
See the chase, the rout, the flight<br />
In deep forest; oread, faun,<br />
Goat-foot, antlers laid on neck;<br />
Ravenous all the line for speed.<br />
See yon wavy sparkle beck<br />
Sign of the Virgin Lady&rsquo;s lead.<br />
Down her course a serpent star<br />
Coils and shatters at her heels;<br />
Peals the horn exulting, peals<br />
Plaintive, is it near or far.<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Huntress,
arrowy to pursue,<br />
In and out of woody glen,<br />
Under cliffs that tear the blue,<br />
Over torrent, over fen,<br />
She and forest, where she skims<br />
Feathery, darken and relume:<br />
Those are her white-lightning limbs<br />
Cleaving loads of leafy gloom.<br />
Mountains hear her and call back,<br />
Shrewd with night: a frosty wail<br />
Distant: her the emerald vale<br />
Folds, and wonders in her track.<br />
Now her retinue is lean,<br />
Many rearward; streams the chase<br />
Eager forth of covert; seen<br />
One hot tide the rapturous race.<br />
Quiver-charged and crescent-crowned,<br />
Up on a flash the lighted mound<br />
Leaps she, bow to shoulder, shaft<br />
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Strung to
barb with archer&rsquo;s craft,<br />
Legs like plaited lyre-chords, feet<br />
Songs to see, past pitch of sweet.<br />
Fearful swiftness they outrun,<br />
Shaggy wildness, grey or dun,<br />
Challenge, charge of tusks elude:<br />
Theirs the dance to tame the rude;<br />
Beast, and beast in manhood tame,<br />
Follow we their silver flame.<br />
Pride of flesh from bondage free,<br />
Reaping vigour of its waste,<br />
Marks her servitors, and she<br />
Sanctifies the unembraced.<br />
Nought of perilous she reeks;<br />
Valour clothes her open breast;<br />
Sweet beyond the thrill of sex;<br />
Hallowed by the sex confessed.<br />
Huntress arrowy to pursue,<br />
Colder she than sunless dew,<br />
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>She, that
breath of upper air;<br />
Ay, but never lyrist sang,<br />
Draught of Bacchus never sprang<br />
Blood the bliss of Gods to share,<br />
High o&rsquo;er sweep of eagle wings,<br />
Like the run with her, when rings<br />
Clear her rally, and her dart,<br />
In the forest&rsquo;s cavern heart,<br />
Tells of her victorious aim.<br />
Then is pause and chatter, cheer,<br />
Laughter at some satyr lame,<br />
Looks upon the fallen deer,<br />
Measuring his noble crest;<br />
Here a favourite in her train,<br />
Foremost mid her nymphs, caressed;<br />
All applauded.&nbsp; Shall she reign<br />
Worshipped?&nbsp; O to be with her there!<br />
She, that breath of nimble air,<br />
Lifts the breast to giant power.<br />
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Maid and
man, and man and maid,<br />
Who each other would devour<br />
Elsewhere, by the chase betrayed,<br />
There are comrades, led by her,<br />
Maid-preserver, man-maker.</p>
<h3><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>WITH THE
PERSUADER</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Who</span> murmurs, hither,
hither: who<br />
Where nought is audible so fills the ear?<br />
Where nought is visible can make appear<br />
A veil with eyes that waver through,<br />
Like twilight&rsquo;s pledge of blessed night to come,<br />
Or day most golden?&nbsp; All unseen and dumb,<br />
She breathes, she moves, inviting flees,<br />
Is lost, and leaves the thrilled desire<br />
To clasp and strike a slackened lyre,<br />
Till over smiles of hyacinth seas,<br />
Flame in a crystal vessel sails<br />
Beneath a dome of jewelled spray,<br />
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>For land
that drops the rosy day<br />
On nights of throbbing nightingales.</p>
<p class="poetry">Landward did the wonder flit,<br />
Or heart&rsquo;s desire of her, all earth in it.<br />
We saw the heavens fling down their rose;<br />
On rapturous waves we saw her glide;<br />
The pearly sea-shell half enclose;<br />
The shoal of sea-nymphs flush the tide;<br />
And we, afire to kiss her feet, no more<br />
Behold than tracks along a startled shore,<br />
With brightened edges of dark leaves that feign<br />
An ambush hoped, as heartless night remain.</p>
<p class="poetry">More closely, warmly: hither, hither! she,<br
/>
The very she called forth by ripened blood<br />
For its next breath of being, murmurs; she,<br />
Allurement; she, fulfilment; she,<br />
The stream within us urged to flood;<br />
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Man&rsquo;s cry, earth&rsquo;s answer, heaven&rsquo;s
consent; O she,<br />
Maid, woman and divinity;<br />
Our over-earthly, inner-earthly mate<br />
Unmated; she, our hunger and our fruit<br />
Untasted; she our written fate<br />
Unread; Life&rsquo;s flowering, Life&rsquo;s root:<br />
Unread, divined; unseen, beheld;<br />
The evanescent, ever-present she,<br />
Great Nature&rsquo;s stern necessity<br />
In radiance clothed, to softness quelled;<br />
With a sword&rsquo;s edge of sweetness keen to take<br />
Our breath for bliss, our hearts for fulness break.</p>
<p class="poetry">The murmur hushes down, the veil is rent.<br />
Man&rsquo;s cry, earth&rsquo;s answer, heaven&rsquo;s consent,<br
/>
Her form is given to pardoned sight,<br />
And lets our mortal eyes receive<br />
The sovereign loveliness of celestial white;<br />
Adored by them who solitarily pace,<br />
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>In dusk of
the underworld&rsquo;s perpetual eve,<br />
The paths among the meadow asphodel,<br />
Remembering.&nbsp; Never there her face<br />
Is planetary; reddens to shore sea-shell<br />
Around such whiteness the enamoured air<br />
Of noon that clothes her, never there.<br />
Daughter of light, the joyful light,<br />
She stands unveiled to nuptial sight,<br />
Sweet in her disregard of aid<br />
Divine to conquer or persuade.<br />
A fountain jets from moss; a flower<br />
Bends gently where her sunset tresses shower.<br />
By guerdon of her brilliance may be seen<br />
With eyelids unabashed the passion&rsquo;s Queen.</p>
<p class="poetry">Shorn of attendant Graces she can use<br />
Her natural snares to make her will supreme.<br />
A simple nymph it is, inclined to muse<br />
Before the leader foot shall dip in stream:<br />
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>One arm at
curve along a rounded thigh;<br />
Her firm new breasts each pointing its own way<br />
A knee half bent to shade its fellow shy,<br />
Where innocence, not nature, signals nay.<br />
The bud of fresh virginity awaits<br />
The wooer, and all roseate will she burst:<br />
She touches on the hour of happy mates;<br />
Still is she unaware she wakens thirst.</p>
<p class="poetry">And while commanding blissful sight believe<br
/>
It holds her as a body strained to breast,<br />
Down on the underworld&rsquo;s perpetual eve<br />
She plunges the possessor dispossessed;<br />
And bids believe that image, heaving warm,<br />
Is lost to float like torch-smoke after flame;<br />
The phantom any breeze blows out of form;<br />
A thirst&rsquo;s delusion, a defeated aim.</p>
<p class="poetry">The rapture shed the torture weaves;<br />
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>The direst
blow on human heart she deals:<br />
The pain to know the seen deceives;<br />
Nought true but what insufferably feels.<br />
And stabs of her delicious note,<br />
That is as heavenly light to hearing, heard<br />
Through shelter leaves, the laughter from her throat,<br />
We answer as the midnight&rsquo;s morning&rsquo;s bird.</p>
<p class="poetry">She laughs, she wakens gleeful cries;<br />
In her delicious laughter part revealed;<br />
Yet mother is she more of moans and sighs,<br />
For longings unappeased and wounds unhealed.<br />
Yet would she bless, it is her task to bless:<br />
Yon folded couples, passing under shade,<br />
Are her rich harvest; bidden caress, caress,<br />
Consume the fruit in bloom; not disobeyed.<br />
We dolorous complainers had a dream,<br />
Wrought on the vacant air from inner fire,<br />
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>We saw
stand bare of her celestial beam<br />
The glorious Goddess, and we dared desire.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thereat are shown reproachful eyes, and lips<br
/>
Of upward curl to meanings half obscure;<br />
And glancing where a wood-nymph lightly skips<br />
She nods: at once that creature wears her lure.<br />
Blush of our being between birth and death:<br />
Sob of our ripened blood for its next breath:<br />
Her wily semblance nought of her denies;<br />
Seems it the Goddess runs, the Goddess hies,<br />
The generous Goddess yields.&nbsp; And she can arm<br />
Her dwarfed and twisted with her secret charm;<br />
Benevolent as Earth to feed her own.<br />
Fully shall they be fed, if they beseech.<br />
But scorn she has for them that walk alone;<br />
Blanched men, starved women, whom no arts can pleach.<br />
The men as chief of criminals she disdains,<br />
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>And holds
the reason in perceptive thought.<br />
More pitiable, like rivers lacking rains,<br />
Kissing cold stones, the women shrink for drought.<br />
Those faceless discords, out of nature strayed,<br />
Rank of the putrefaction ere decayed,<br />
In impious singles bear the thorny wreaths:<br />
Their lives are where harmonious Pleasure breathes<br />
For couples crowned with flowers that burn in dew.<br />
Comes there a tremor of night&rsquo;s forest horn<br />
Across her garden from the insaner crew,<br />
She darkens to malignity of scorn.<br />
A shiver courses through her garden-grounds:<br />
Grunt of the tusky boar, the baying hounds,<br />
The hunter&rsquo;s shouts, are heard afar, and bring<br />
Dead on her heart her crimsoned flower of Spring.<br />
These, the irreverent of Life&rsquo;s design,<br />
Division between natural and divine<br />
Would cast; these vaunting barrenness for best,<br />
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>In veins
of gathered strength Life&rsquo;s tide arrest;<br />
And these because the roses flood their cheeks,<br />
Vow them in nature wise as when Love speaks.<br />
With them is war; and well the Goddess knows<br />
What undermines the race who mount the rose;<br />
How the ripe moment, lodged in slumberous hours,<br />
Enkindled by persuasion overpowers:<br />
Why weak as are her frailer trailing weeds,<br />
The strong when Beauty gleams o&rsquo;er Nature&rsquo;s needs,<br
/>
And timely guile unguarded finds them lie.<br />
They who her sway withstand a sea defy,<br />
At every point of juncture must be proof;<br />
Nor look for mercy from the incessant surge<br />
Her forces mixed of craft and passion urge<br />
For the one whelming wave to spring aloof.<br />
She, tenderness, is pitiless to them<br />
Resisting in her godhead nature&rsquo;s truth.<br />
No flower their face shall be, but writhen stem;<br />
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Their
youth a frost, their age the dirge for youth.<br />
These miserably disinclined,<br />
The lamentably unembraced,<br />
Insult the Pleasures Earth designed<br />
To people and beflower the waste.<br />
Wherefore the Pleasures pass them by:<br />
For death they live, in life they die.</p>
<p class="poetry">Her head the Goddess from them turns,<br />
As from grey mounds of ashes in bronze urns.<br />
She views her quivering couples unconsoled,<br />
And of her beauty mirror they become,<br />
Like orchard blossoms, apple, pear and plum,<br />
Free of the cloud, beneath the flood of gold.<br />
Crowned with wreaths that burn in dew,<br />
Her couples whirl, sun-satiated,<br />
Athirst for shade, they sigh, they wed,<br />
They play the music made of two:<br />
Oldest of earth, earth&rsquo;s youngest till earth&rsquo;s
end:<br />
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Cunninger
than the numbered strings,<br />
For melodies, for harmonies,<br />

Resounded under, heard I these discourse.</p>

Of wing shall master till men hear her teach.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Liker the clod flaked by the driving
plough,<br />
My semblance when I have you not as now.<br />
The quiet creatures who escape mishap<br />
Bear likeness to pure growths of the green sap:<br />

By cowards shunning strife or strivers tired.<br />
I listen at their breasts: is there no jar<br />
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Of
wrestlings and of stranglings, dead they are,<br />
And such a picture as the piercing mind<br />
Ranks beneath vegetation.&nbsp; Not resigned<br />
Are my true pupils while the world is brute.<br />
What edict of the stronger keeps me mute,<br />
Stronger impels the motion of my heart.<br />
I am not Resignation&rsquo;s counterpart.<br />
If that I teach, &rsquo;tis little the dry word,<br />
Content, but how to savour hope deferred.<br />
We come of earth, and rich of earth may be;<br />
Soon carrion if very earth are we!<br />
The coursing veins, the constant breath, the use<br />
Of sleep, declare that strife allows short truce;<br />
Unless we clasp decay, accept defeat,<br />
And pass despised; &ldquo;a-cold for lack of heat,&rdquo;<br />
Like other corpses, but without death&rsquo;s plea.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;My sister calls for battle; is it
she?</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Than stagnant, where the sensual piper charms<br />
Each drowsy malady and coiling vice<br />
With dreams of ease whereof the soul pays price!<br />
No home is here for peace while evil breeds,<br />
While error governs, none; and must the seeds<br />
You sow, you that for long have reaped disdain,<br />
Lie barren at the doorway of the brain,<br />
Let stout contention drive deep furrows, blood<br />
Moisten, and make new channels of its flood!</p>

first,<br />
Drinks of me ever with an eager thirst.<br />
So can I not of her till circumstance<br />

Like dead weeds on whipped waters.&nbsp; Shout the word<br />

Gaze to the primal twistings of the worm.<br />

Men&rsquo;s early form of speech for Yes and No.<br />
My sister a bruised infant&rsquo;s utterance had;<br />
And issuing stronger, to mankind &rsquo;twas mad.<br />

bloodshed!<br />
So now go I to Phthia, for better by much it beseems me<br />

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Like</span> as a terrible
fire feeds fast on a forest enormous,<br />
Up on a mountain height, and the blaze of it radiates round
far,<br />
So on the bright blest arms of the host in their march did the
splendour<br />
Gleam wide round through the circle of air right up to the
sky-vault.<br />
They, now, as when swarm thick in the air multitudinous winged
flocks,<br />
Be it of geese or of cranes or the long-necked troops of the
wild-swans,<br />
Off that Asian mead, by the flow of the waters of
Ka&iuml;stros;<br />
Hither and yon fly they, and rejoicing in pride of their
pinions,<br />
<a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>Clamour,
shaped to their ranks, and the mead all about them resoundeth;<br

So those numerous tribes from their ships and their shelterings
poured forth<br />
On that plain of Scamander, and horrible rumbled beneath them<br
/>
Earth to the quick-paced feet of the men and the tramp of the
horse-hooves.<br />
Stopped they then on the fair-flower&rsquo;d field of Scamander,
their thousands<br />
Many as leaves and the blossoms born of the flowerful season.<br
/>
Even as countless hot-pressed flies in their multitudes
traverse,<br />
Clouds of them, under some herdsman&rsquo;s wonning, where then
are the milk-pails<br />
Also, full of their milk, in the bountiful season of
spring-time;<br />
Even so thickly the long-haired sons of Achaia the plain held,<br
/>
Prompt for the dash at the Trojan host, with the passion to crush
them.<br />
<a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>Those,
likewise, as the goatherds, eyeing their vast flocks of goats,
know<br />
Easily one from the other when all get mixed o&rsquo;er the
pasture,<br />
So did the chieftains rank them here there in their places for
onslaught,<br />
Hard on the push of the fray; and among them King Agamemnon,<br

He, for his eyes and his head, as when Zeus glows glad in his

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">These</span>, then, he
left, and away where ranks were now clashing the thickest,<br />
Onward rushed, and with him rushed all of the bright-greaved
Achaians.<br />
Foot then footmen slew, that were flying from direful
compulsion,<br />
Horse at the horsemen (up from off under them mounted the
dust-cloud,<br />
Up off the plain, raised up cloud-thick by the thundering
horse-hooves)<br />
Hewed with the sword&rsquo;s sharp edge; and so meanwhile Lord
Agamemnon<br />
Followed, chasing and slaughtering aye, on-urgeing the
Argives.</p>

unclipp&egrave;d woodland,<br />
This way bears it and that the great whirl of the wind, and the
scrubwood<br />
Stretches uptorn, flung forward alength by the fire&rsquo;s fury
rageing,<br />
So beneath Atreides Agamemnon heads of the scattered<br />
Trojans fell; and in numbers amany the horses, neck-stiffened,<br
/>
Rattled their vacant cars down the roadway gaps of the
war-field,<br />
Missing the blameless charioteers, but, for these, they were
outstretched<br />
Flat upon earth, far dearer to vultures than to their

class="smcap">So</span> he, with a clear shout of laughter,<br />
Forth of his ambush leapt, and he vaunted him, uttering
thiswise:<br />
&ldquo;Hit thou art! not in vain flew the shaft; how by rights it
had pierced thee<br />
Into the undermost gut, therewith to have rived thee of
life-breath!<br />
Following that had the Trojans plucked a new breath from their
direst,<br />
They all frighted of thee, as the goats bleat in flight from a
lion.&rdquo;<br />
Then unto him untroubled made answer stout Diomedes:<br />
&ldquo;Bow-puller, jiber, thy bow for thy glorying, spyer at
virgins!<br />
<a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>If that
thou dared&rsquo;st face me here out in the open with weapons,<br
/>
Nothing then would avail thee thy bow and thy thick shot of
arrows.<br />
Now thou plumest thee vainly because of a graze of my
footsole;<br />
Reck I as were that stroke from a woman or some pettish
infant.<br />
Aye flies blunted the dart of the man that&rsquo;s emasculate,
noughtworth!<br />
Otherwise hits, forth flying from me, and but strikes it the
slightest,<br />
My keen shaft, and it numbers a man of the dead fallen
straightway.<br />
Torn, troth, then are the cheeks of the wife of that man fallen
slaughtered,<br />
Orphans his babes, full surely he reddens the earth with his
blood-drops,<br />
Rotting, round him the birds, more numerous they than the
women.&rdquo;</p>

fountain-abundant Ida, mother of wild beasts,<br />
Came, and they first left ocean to fare over mainland at
Lektos,<br />
Where underneath of their feet waved loftiest growths of the
woodland.<br />
There hung Hypnos fast, ere the vision of Zeus was observant,<br

Mounted upon a tall pine-tree, tallest of pines that on Ida<br />
Lustily spring off soil for the shoot up aloft into aether.<br />
There did he sit well-cloaked by the wide-branched pine for

&ldquo;Why, ye hapless, gave we to Peleus you, to a mortal<br />

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
